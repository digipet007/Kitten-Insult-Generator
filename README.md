# Kitten-Insult-Generator
The kitten insult generator generates an insult made up of two random adjectives and a random noun above a randomly generated picture of a cat.
We used three different APIs for this: Words API, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary API, and The Cat API.

## Installation

```git clone https://github.com/jackb312/Kitten-Insult-Generator.git```
